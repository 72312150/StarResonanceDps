Key data capture and analytics in this project are ported from [StarResonanceDamageCounter](https://github.com/dmlgzs/StarResonanceDamageCounter). Many thanks to the original author for the guidance and support.

The toolbox works without modifying the game client and stays within the game’s terms of service. It helps players understand combat data, avoid inefficient upgrades, and improve overall gameplay. Please refrain from weaponizing any analytics output—for example, using it for damage-based discrimination that harms the community.
